# Programming and use of the Marenostrum 5 supercomputer
This GitHub repository contains the support code for the lab sessions in the courses I teach at the UPC where the use of the Marenostrum 5 supercomputer is required.

MareNostrum 5 is a pre-exascale EuroHPC supercomputer hosted at BSC-CNS. The system is supplied by Bull SAS combining Bull Sequana XH3000 and Lenovo ThinkSystem architectures and it has a total peak computational power of 314PFlops. It consists of two computer partitions with the shared file system:
* [MARENOSTRUM 5 GPP](https://www.top500.org/system/180237/): General Purpose partition based on Intel Sapphire Rapids, 6408 nodes + 72 HBM nodes (45 PFlops peak)
* [MARENOSTRUM 5 ACC](https://www.top500.org/system/180238/): Accelerated Partition based on Intel Sapphire Rapids and Nvidia Hopper GPUs, 1120 nodes with 4 Hopper GPUs each one, (230 PFlops peak)
